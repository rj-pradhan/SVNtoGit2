	<![CDATA[Renders an HTML "table" element, conforming to the
          rules in the HTML 401 specification.  If the "styleClass"
          attribute is specified, render its value as the value of the
          "class" attribute.  Render the pass-through attributes in the
          table below.  Render the "header" facet, if present, inside of
          "thead", "tr", and "th" elements, nested in that order.  If the
          "headerClass" attribute is specified, render its value as the value
          of the "class" attribute on the "th" element.  Render "colgroup"
          as the value of the "scope" attribute.  Render the value of the
          "columns" attribute as the value of the "colspan" attribute on the
          "th" element.  Render the "footer" facet if present, using similar
          logic to the rendering of the "header", but replacing "thead" with
          "tfoot", "th" with "td", and "headerClass" with "footerClass".
          Render the children of the <code>UIPanel</code> component inside
          of a "tbody" element.  Render the children based on the value of
          the "columns" attribute, creating a new row each time a "columns"
          worth of children have been rendered.  Each child is rendered
          inside of a "td" element.  If a child has "rendered==false" it is
          not rendered, and the column counter must not be incremented.
