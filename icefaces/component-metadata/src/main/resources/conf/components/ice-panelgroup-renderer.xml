		<![CDATA[<p>The panelGroup component is intended for use in situations when only one UIComponent child can
          be nested, such as in the case of facets. The panelGroup component renders a "div" element around it's child
          components, outputting the value of the "style" attribute as the value of the "style" attribute, and the
          value of the "styleClass" attribute as the value of the "class" attribute.
          <p>The panelGroup can also provide Drag & Drop functionality to it's child components. See the Drag & Drop
          documentation details.
          <p>The panelGroup component can also be used to apply a single Effect (Fade, Show, etc.) to a set of
          child-components by adding the components to the panelGroup and specifying the effect on the panelGroup
          "effect" attribute.]]>
