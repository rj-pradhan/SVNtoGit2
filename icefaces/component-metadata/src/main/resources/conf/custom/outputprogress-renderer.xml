		<![CDATA[<p>The outputProgress component can be used to report progress to users in cases where a
            long running server-side task is necessary. This component can be run in either of two modes;
            "determinate" and "indeterminate".
            <p>
            Determinate mode should be used in cases where the number of steps or units of work in a long-running
            process are known. In determinate mode (default) the outputProgress component renders a progress bar
            that indicates the completion percentage for a task. Typically, the progress bar will gradually progress
            from 0 to 100 % complete in incremental steps determined by the application.
            <p>
            Indeterminate mode should be used in cases when it is not possible to predicate how long a long-running
            process will take to complete, or how many steps or units of work are required to complete the task.
            In indeterminate mode the outputProgress component renders an animated icon or progress bar that
            indicates generally that  activity is taking place.
