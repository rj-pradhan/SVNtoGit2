  <property>
    <description>	
        By default, the panelGroup component is rendered on the same line as the component
        that comes before it and the component that follows, in a flow layout.  If the block attribute
        is set to true, the panelGroup component is rendered on its own line. The components
        before it and after it are on different lines. The block attribute has no effect on the 
        panelGroup component's children.
