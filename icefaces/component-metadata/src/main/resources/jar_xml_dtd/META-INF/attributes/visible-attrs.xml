     Use the visible attribute to indicate whether the component should be
    viewable by the user in the rendered HTML page. If set to false, the
    HTML code for the component is present in the page, but the component
    is hidden with style attributes. By default, visible is set to true, so
    HTML for the component HTML is included and visible to the user. If the
    component is not visible, it can still be processed on subsequent form
    submissions because the HTML is present.
