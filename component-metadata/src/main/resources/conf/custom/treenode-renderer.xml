          <![CDATA[<p> The treeNode tag provides the template that be applied in rendering each node in the
            backing data model. The treeNode tag supports two facets: the icon facet and the content facet. The icon facet is 
            intended to contain a graphic image that will serve as the icon for the node it represents. This 
            image can be customized for each node, or default icons for leaf nodes, expand branch nodes, and contracted 
            branch nodes will be used. The content facet can contain any collection of components. For each node in the tree's backing 
            data model, the child components of the two facets will be rendered with state retrieved from the
            data model as configured in the JSP by the application developer.<br> ]]>
